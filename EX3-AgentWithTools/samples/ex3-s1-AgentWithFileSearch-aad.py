# 0. Import necessary libraries and set up environment variables
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# This example demonstrates how to create an AI Agent with File Search capabilities
# using Azure AI Foundry. File Search allows agents to find and retrieve information
# from uploaded documents, making it perfect for:
#   - Technical documentation queries
#   - Policy and procedure lookups  
#   - Knowledge base interactions
#   - Industrial manual consultations
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
import os

from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.ai.projects.models import (
    FileSearchToolDefinition,
    ToolConnectionDefinition, 
    ConnectionType
)
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables from a .env file
load_dotenv()

# 1. Environment Variables Setup
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Required environment variables for Azure AI Foundry:
# - AI_FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT: Your Azure AI Foundry project endpoint
# - AI_FOUNDRY_DEPLOYMENT_NAME: The model deployment you want to use
#
# For File Search, the agent will automatically create and manage:
#   - Vector stores for document indexing
#   - File uploads and processing
#   - Search indexes for fast retrieval
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
azure_foundry_project_endpoint = os.getenv("AI_FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT")
azure_foundry_deployment = os.getenv("AI_FOUNDRY_DEPLOYMENT_NAME")

# 2. Authentication Setup using DefaultAzureCredential
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# DefaultAzureCredential automatically discovers and uses the best available credential:
#   1. Environment variables (AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET)
#   2. Managed Identity (for Azure-hosted applications)  
#   3. Visual Studio Code authentication
#   4. Azure CLI authentication (`az login`)
#   5. Interactive browser authentication (fallback)
#
# Perfect for development environments where you're already authenticated
# via Azure CLI or VS Code. No need to manage secrets locally.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------

# 3. AI Project Client Setup
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
project = AIProjectClient(
    endpoint=azure_foundry_project_endpoint,
    credential=DefaultAzureCredential()
)

# 4. File Search Tool Configuration
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# File Search is a powerful knowledge tool that enables agents to:
#   - Index uploaded documents automatically
#   - Perform semantic search across document content
#   - Extract relevant passages with citations
#   - Handle multiple document formats (PDF, TXT, DOCX, etc.)
#
# The tool creates vector embeddings of document content for fast,
# accurate search and retrieval during conversations.
